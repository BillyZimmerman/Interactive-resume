Through my full-time work, I've developed strong skills in creating functional, visually appealing sites that work great across all devices. I'm now offering freelance services to help more businesses establish their online presence and reach their digital goals.

                    <p>
                      As a full-time front-end developer, I specialize in
                      Shopify development with extensive experience building
                      hundreds of stores over the past two years. While I can
                      work with other platforms including Big Cartel and Wix, my
                      deep Shopify expertise allows me to deliver best results
                      and service for clients using that platform.

                      Whether you need a brand new site, a redesign of your current one, or specific improvements like mobile optimization, I can deliver solutions that help your business grow and look great! I believe in clear communication throughout the process, so you'll always know what's happening. If you're on a budget, I can still make you a site to be proud of.

You might need a website or possibly an update to your current site, maybe some help fine-tuning your site for mobile. I think you could benefit from improved web presence, and I'd love to help you achieve your online goals. You can trust my experience to help your business grow.

          I believe in clear, honest communication from day one. I'll keep you updated on progress, ask questions when I need to, and respond quickly when you reach out - no corporate jargon, just straightforward updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          When problems pop up (and they always do), I dig in and figure them out. Years of troubleshooting have taught me to stay calm under pressure and find creative solutions that actually work.

          I speak both "developer" and "business owner" fluently. I can explain technical stuff in plain English and understand what features will actually help grow your business, not just look pretty.
        </li>
        <li>
          I work well on my own and adapt quickly when projects take unexpected turns. I'm naturally curious and always learning new techniques to stay current with what's working in e-commerce.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm thorough with testing because I hate when things break after launch. I check everything across different browsers and devices to make sure your customers have a smooth experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having run my own projects, I understand the stress of tight budgets and deadlines. I approach every client's store like it's my own business - focusing on what will actually move the needle for you.

          <h2>My Process</h2>
          <p class="body">
            I'm launching a side business building websites, with a focus on
            eCommerce. I have 10+ years of experience creating online stores
            using platforms like Big Cartel, Wix, and especially Shopify. For
            the past two years, I've worked at a company that hosts and
            maintains over 1,000 Shopify stores, giving me hands-on experience
            with a wide range of shop setups. I also ran my own store in the
            past, selling merch and event tickets. Shopify is my specialty, and
            I recommend it for its cost-effectiveness and efficient development
            process.

                Let's start with a free 15-minute consultation to see if we're a
                good match. I'll ask about your business, your goals, and who
                your customers are so we can figure out what your website needs
                most.

                get approval on all design elements before starting development
