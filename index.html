                    <p>
                      Hello, I'm Billy Zimmerman, a passionate front end web
                      developer with 5+ years of experience in the industry. I
                      love creating digital solutions that make a real
                      difference for businesses. I thrive on taking a design and
                      bringing it to life. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing
                      video games and spending time with my wife and cats.

                    <h4>Billy's Strengths</h4>
                    <p>
                      As a front-end developer, my core strengths lie in Shopify
                      development and customization. I excel at creating
                      responsive themes, optimizing store performance, and
                      implementing custom functionality that drives conversions.
                      My understanding of Shopify's liquid templating system
                      allows me to build unique shopping experiences while
                      maintaining platform reliability and seamless operations.

                    <p>
                      Before transitioning into web development, I ran my own
                      business using Shopify to sell products and event tickets.
                      Since then I've built hundreds of websites ranging from
                      small business sites to complex e-commerce platforms. My
                      full-time development role has deepened my Shopify
                      expertise, where I've created custom themes and
                      functionality, helping businesses of all sizes!

                    <p>
                      Shopify offers the perfect balance of power and simplicity
                      for e-commerce businesses. Its robust ecosystem, reliable
                      hosting, and built-in payment processing make it ideal for
                      scaling. Through extensive professional and personal
                      experience with the platform, I leverage its advanced
                      features to create custom solutions that drive sales.
                      Plus, it's user-friendly enough for clients to manage
                      stores independently after launch.

                  I believe in clear, honest communication from day one. I'll
                  keep you updated on progress, ask questions when I need to,
                  and respond quickly when you reach out - no corporate jargon,
                  just straightforward updates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When problems pop up (and they always do), I dig in and figure
                  them out. Years of troubleshooting have taught me to stay calm
                  under pressure and find creative solutions that actually work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I speak both "developer" and "business owner" fluently. I can
                  explain technical stuff in plain English and understand what
                  features will actually help grow your business, not just look
                  pretty.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I work well on my own and adapt quickly when projects take
                  unexpected turns. I'm naturally curious and always learning
                  new techniques to stay current with what's working in
                  e-commerce.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I'm thorough with testing because I hate when things break
                  after launch. I check everything across different browsers and
                  devices to make sure your customers have a smooth experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Having run my own projects, I understand the stress of tight
                  budgets and deadlines. I approach every client's store like
                  it's my own business - focusing on what will actually move the
                  needle for you.

                    Migrated over their website to a different theme. This was a
                    big upgrade from the older theme. Made for easier updates on
                    the clients side. Same website but better tools for updating
                    and creating new content.

                    Took full lead on the rebuild of Noondays new website.
                    Worked closely with their designer and team to ensure the
                    new design met their vision and addressed all custom
                    solutions needed for the project.

                    I had a blast working on this complete rebuild for It's A
                    2000's Party! Working from detailed mockups, I created
                    custom solutions that captured nostalgic 2000s energy.
